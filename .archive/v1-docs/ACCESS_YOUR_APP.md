## 🔍 Why "Access Denied" Happened

The issue was likely:
- Flask wasn't running yet, OR
- You tried to access before starting the server

**Now both are running:**
- ✅ Flask: http://127.0.0.1:5000
- ✅ ngrok: https://bc87c231fa2e.ngrok-free.app

## 💡 Tips

### The URLs Explained
- **localhost:5000** - Only works on your Mac
- **ngrok URL** - Works from anywhere (phone, other computers)

### Keep Terminals Open
- Don't close the terminal windows
- Both Flask and ngrok need to stay running
- If you close them, just restart

### ngrok URL Changes
- The ngrok URL changes each time you restart ngrok
- This is normal for the free tier
- Just update your bookmark when it changes
