## 🚀 How to Access Your App

```
http://localhost:5000
```

### Option 2: Public Access (Any Device)
Open in your browser:
```
https://bc87c231fa2e.ngrok-free.app
```

**⚠️ Important for ngrok Free Tier:**
The first time you visit the ngrok URL, you'll see a warning page that says:
> "You are about to visit bc87c231fa2e.ngrok-free.app"

Just click **"Visit Site"** to continue. This is normal for ngrok's free tier.

## 🧪 Test It's Working

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/get-items
```
Should return: `[]` (empty list)

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/add-item \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text":"milk, eggs, bread"}'
```
Should return: `{"added": ["Milk", "Eggs", "Bread"], ...}`

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Access Denied" on localhost:5000
**Solution:** Make sure Flask is running. Check the terminal where you ran `python app.py`

### ngrok URL shows 403 error
**Solution:** Visit the URL in a browser first and click "Visit Site" on the warning page

### ngrok URL changes every time
**Solution:** This is normal for ngrok free tier. The URL changes when you restart ngrok.
- For a permanent URL, upgrade to ngrok paid plan
- Or just update your bookmark when it changes

### Can't access from iPhone
**Solution:** 
1. Make sure both Flask and ngrok are running
2. Use the HTTPS ngrok URL (not http://localhost)
3. Click through the ngrok warning page
