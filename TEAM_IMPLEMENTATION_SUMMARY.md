## ✅ Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
1. ✅ Add simple item: "milk" → appears as "Milk"
2. ✅ Add multiple items: "milk, eggs, bread" → three separate items
3. ✅ Delete items by clicking in web UI
4. ✅ De-duplication: adding "milk" twice → only one "Milk"
5. ✅ Case insensitive: "Milk" and "milk" treated as same item
6. ✅ Natural language: "I need milk and eggs" → extracts both items
7. ✅ Quantity handling: "2 gallons of milk" → adds "Milk"
8. ✅ Persistence: items survive page refresh
9. ✅ iOS integration: send message via Shortcuts → items appear

### Technical Requirements
- ✅ 85%+ test coverage
- ✅ All automated tests passing
- ✅ < 1 second response time for typical operations
- ✅ Deployed to Replit with public HTTPS URL
- ✅ Complete documentation (setup, API, iOS guide)

## 📊 Risk Assessment

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| **Parsing inaccuracy** | HIGH | 50+ test cases, iterative refinement, fallback handling |

## 🔑 Key Decisions Made

### Technical Decisions
1. **Database:** Plain text file (simple, sufficient for personal use)
2. **Parsing Strategy:** Regex + string manipulation (no external APIs)
3. **Testing Framework:** pytest with pytest-flask (industry standard)
4. **Deployment:** Replit (free, easy HTTPS, good for personal projects)
5. **De-duplication:** Case-insensitive with quantity-agnostic matching

### Process Decisions
1. **Git Workflow:** Feature branches with PR reviews
2. **Testing:** TDD approach (tests written alongside code)
3. **Communication:** Daily standups (15 min) + weekly milestone reviews
4. **Code Review:** Tech Lead reviews all PRs within 4 hours
5. **Documentation:** Inline code comments + separate guide docs

## ❓ FAQ

### Q: Why 3 weeks for such a simple app?
**A:** The 3-week timeline includes:
- Buffer time for unexpected issues
- Comprehensive testing (100+ test cases)
- Documentation and deployment
- iOS integration testing
Actual coding is ~2 weeks; Week 3 is polish and QA.

### Q: Why plain text file instead of a database?
**A:** For personal use with <100 items:
- Plain text is simpler (no DB setup)
- Fast enough (< 1s operations)
- Easy to backup and inspect
- No additional dependencies

### Q: What if parsing doesn't work perfectly?
**A:** The parsing has:
- 50+ test cases covering common scenarios
- Fallback to raw text if parsing fails
- Iterative refinement based on real usage
- Documented limitations

### Q: How does iOS integration work?
**A:** iOS Shortcuts app sends HTTP POST to Replit URL:
```json
POST https://your-app.replit.dev/add-item
Body: {"text": "We need milk and eggs"}
```
Backend parses text, adds items, returns success.

### Q: What if someone adds 10,000 items?
**A:** Current design handles ~1,000 items comfortably:
- 1000 items = ~10KB file (negligible)
- < 1s read/write operations
- < 10 MB memory usage
For >1,000 items, consider migrating to SQLite (future enhancement).
